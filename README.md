# Lawyers
This is my side project. Small Lawyers group wants a landing page with some extra features like to be able to create and edit publications: news, current propositions, events report etc. This project contains landing page with some improvements, and small backend application - it helps to store and edit their publications which should include headline, main content and an image.
Backend -springboot, db - mysql. Also implemented spring security to prevent unauthorized changes.
